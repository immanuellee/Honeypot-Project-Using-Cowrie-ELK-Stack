# Honeypot-Project-Using-Cowrie-ELK-Stack

This project involves deploying a Cowrie honeypot to capture unauthorized SSH login attempts and attacker behavior. The captured logs are processed and visualized using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to analyze attack patterns, identify malicious activity, and enhance cybersecurity defenses. The project provides hands-on experience in honeypot deployment, log analysis, and real-time threat intelligence, helping to understand attacker tactics and improve security strategies.
