# Honeypot-Project-Using-Cowrie-ELK-Stack (Collaborative Personal Project with Aslam Bwanika)
<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves deploying a Cowrie honeypot to capture unauthorized SSH login attempts and attacker behavior. The captured logs are processed and visualized using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to analyze attack patterns, identify malicious activity, and enhance cybersecurity defenses. The project provides hands-on experience in honeypot deployment, log analysis, and real-time threat intelligence, helping to understand attacker tactics and improve security strategies.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Honeypot Security: Cowrie (for capturing and logging unauthorized SSH/Telnet access attempts)</b> 

- <b>Log Management & Visualization: ELK Stack (for processing, indexing, and analyzing honeypot logs)</b>
  
- <b>Scripting Languages: Python – Used for running Cowrie and processing logs.
Bash/Shell Scripting – For configuring and managing the Linux-based honeypot system.)</b>
  
- <b>Threat Intelligence: Kibana (for visualizing attack patterns, failed logins, and malicious activity)</b>
  
- <b>Virtualization: UTM (for creating isolated lab environments)</b>

- <b>Operating System: Kali Linux (for hosting the honeypot and performing security analysis)</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>UTM</b> 
  
- <b>Kali Linux</b> 
  
- <b>Cowrie</b> 
  
- <b>Wireshark & tcpdump</b> 
  
- <b>ELK Stack</b>
